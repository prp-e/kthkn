# KTHKN stands for _Kootah Kon_. 

It's just another URL shortener I wrote. This is just the API. I'll put specifications and guidelines as soon as possible. 

## TODO 

- [ ] Providing Open API v3.0 specifications. 
- [x] Providing a _domain_ envorionment variable. 
- [x] Providing a _database_ environment variable. 
- [ ] Making front-end (maybe in another repository.)
